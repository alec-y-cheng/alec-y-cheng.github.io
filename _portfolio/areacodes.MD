I had always had a bizarre passion for US area codes and their history. Area codes are more than just three-digit numbers that represent a particular location. Their development also tells us a story of population growth, where new codes emerging in some places indicate rapid growth, like Southern California, while stagnant or declining populations have kept the same codes for decades, like California's sparsely populated Northeast. 
<br>
<br>
An area code map is also analagous to a population density map. Area codes roughly serve the same population, meaning that an area code serving a small region, like Downtown LA's 213, has about as many people as California's desert code 760.
<br>
<br>
Area code development also tells a story of changing telecommunications practices, showing the rise of local competition for cellular service in the mid 90s. 
<br>
<br>
And to many, area codes are an identity. Some proud cities are reluctant to give up their code, or share it with an overlay. The reputation and public attachment associated with Nashville's 615, SF's 415, Miami's 305, and Manhattan's 212 show that area codes are symbols of hometown pride.
<br>
<br>
I wanted to make a detailed, coherent diagram that could tell all these stories as they were told in California, the state with the most area codes. Here is my final map.

The final map was not the first map. In creating this project, I wanted to show the area codes, the passing of time, and geographic region and area size of each code. I experimented and iterated with many versions, some more comprehensible, some more informative. Throughout my design process, you can see my emphasis on different aspects of the maps that I ultimately consolidated into my final version.
