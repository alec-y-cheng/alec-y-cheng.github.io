## A &#42*New*&#42 Program for Graphic Design Redesign

<A *New* Program for Graphic Design> is a book of contemporary design principles of the last century that have defined the discourse of design education. It was the guiding book of my graphic design class, and one such project was to redesign the cover, originally written in English, into another language. I chose Hungarian, and used Moholy-Nagy's design principles and aesthetics to guide my design.

## A Typoloy of American Houses

I've done a few experimemts in the making of typologies. One such project was in the various houses that are present in the US, from New England to Southwest, Colonial to Modern times.

## A Typology of Corners in the Vaughn Home

The Vaughn home is a historic building on Vanderbilt's campus that stood as a professor's house, girls' dorm, then into a center for humanities. In celebration of Vanderbilt's sesquicentennial anniversary, the Vaughn home was turned into an art and history museum that showcased its significance to Vanderbilt's multiple eras. In one of many studies of the house's form, architecture, and history, I created a typology of the various forms, textures, and colors found in the house's interior corners.


## Vaughn Home Postcard

In another project to rebrand the Vaughn home during its 150th year birthday, I created a design for a Vaughn Home-themed postcard that integrates the shape of the Vaughn home facade and forward-thinking aesthetic of the next era of the Vanderbilt and the Vaughn home's journey.

In addition to establishing connections to the Nashville Food Project, creating a convenient website, and creating an improved outreach system, she was interested in a more professional rebranding of her logo that she could display on business documents. Her current logo was an endearing hand drawing of her window and some of her core values, but might not have been the best fit for small-scale display on printed documents. The most important idea she wants in her logo is love, and my redesigned logo embodies this and the goals and values of her business in a much simpler icon.

I communicated frequently with Ms. Samaria regarding her preferences for the design and her feedback on my current progress. We went through many iterations and experiments until we landed on the one that she loved.
