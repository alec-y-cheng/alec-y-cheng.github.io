<h2>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">&ast;New&ast;</span> Program for Graphic Design Redesign</h2>

<u>A &ast;New&ast; Program for Graphic Design</u> by David Reinfurt is a book of contemporary design principles of the last century that defined the discourse of design education. It was the guiding book of my graphic design class, and one such project was to redesign the cover, originally written in English, into another language. I chose Hungarian, and used Moholy-Nagy's design principles and aesthetics to guide my design.

## A Typoloy of American Houses

I've done a few experimemts in the making of typologies. One such project was in the various houses that are present in the US, from New England to Southwest, Colonial to Modern times.

## A Typology of Corners in the Vaughn Home

The Vaughn home is a historic building on Vanderbilt's campus that stood as a professor's house, girls' dorm, then into a center for humanities. In celebration of Vanderbilt's sesquicentennial anniversary, the Vaughn home was turned into an art and history museum that showcased its significance to Vanderbilt's multiple eras. In one of many studies of the house's form, architecture, and history, I created a typology of the various forms, textures, and colors found in the house's interior corners.

## Vaughn Home Postcard

In another project to rebrand the Vaughn home during its 150th year birthday, I created a design for a Vaughn Home-themed postcard that integrates the shape of the Vaughn home facade and forward-thinking aesthetic of the next era of the Vanderbilt and the Vaughn home's journey.
